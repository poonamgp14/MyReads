#MyReads

Is a react based UI project which renders books into three categories(Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read). The books can be shuffled into any category. For example, after finished reading books inside Currently Reading category can be moved to read category and so on. There is a Search feature implemented at `/search` where books can be searched using any key word and can be added to any shelf category.
## TL;DR
